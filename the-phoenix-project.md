# The Phoenix Project

## Chapter 7

WIP is the "silent killer" 

Any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless,
because it will always remained starved, waiting for the bottleneck. And any improvements made before the bottleneck merely
results in more inventory piling up at the bottleneck.

Your job is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planne dwork that delivers value to the business
while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service

### The Three Ways
1. Helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves
2. shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework
3. Shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously foster experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that 
repition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery
